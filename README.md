# vlcradiologger
Logs song/artist names on vlc media player radio stations.

It looks for a window title ending with "VLC media player".
Keeps track of which is the current song.
Saves songs names to specified .txt file whenever the title of the window changed.

The code is far from perfect, needs some refractoring probably.
